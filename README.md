In this project, I developed and deployed a dynamic E-Commerce website leveraging Angular, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website was designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for customers, allowing them to browse through products, search for specific items, add products to their cart, and easily place orders. To ensure efficient product management, I implemented seamless CRUD operations using JSON server, enabling sellers to effortlessly add, update, and delete products through a streamlined interface. This comprehensive solution aimed to enhance the overall shopping experience while empowering sellers with efficient product management capabilities.
